#### A blast from the past üï∞

### Information hiding

[*D.L. Parnas - "On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules"*](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf)

???

So I went looking for some inspiration, and learned about Parnas' work
about modularization in the 1970s, words that stand still today.

???


In this paper, he took a look at a program that did text processing and
compared two approaches - one that divided up its processing
responsibilities by its procedural components, do A, B, then C, and
another one that was responsible for the individual design decisions to
do various things like scan for words, storing data in internal data
structures, etc.

It might go without saying, but the second one was found much more
flexible and elegant. He said that the second way allowed the user to
change internal decisions like how lines were stored in memory or on
disk in a particular data structure would require minimal changes,
whereas in the first, if you changed the data structure backing the word
list you'd have to change several modules.

"We propose instead that one begins with a **list of difficult design decisions** or **design decisions which are likely to change**.

"Each module is then designed to **hide such a decision from the others.**" (Emphasis added)

???

His point was that modules need to hide away minute implementation
details from other modules - things that are likely to change! Where you
draw the boundaries in your system matters, because they allow you to
flexibly change your approach without messing with other parts of the
system later.

Sounds obvious, right? This paper eventually got the discussion rolling
into the design principles which we call "High Cohesion, Loose Coupling"
today.

## From software program to the entire system

Where are the difficult design decisions in this company that are likely to change?

???

Even though Parnas' paper looked at a single program and attempted to
rethink its division of labor from flow to responsibility, I want to
zoom out and apply this to our entire business system.

Where do those difficult design decisions come from, within our company?

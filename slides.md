#### .left[Axiom #1 üîÆ]
# Maintaining large systems is difficult*

--
#### * like, super mega difficult

???

As you might know, a good portion of our professional lives as programmers is spent chasing the dragons of complexity

---

class: center

#### .left[Axiom #2 üîÆ]
# Complex systems are not intentionally messy*

--
#### * for the most part

---

### The bulk of complexity is accidental

Let's ship things fast! üòß

--

Death by a thousand cuts

--

Abstractions that might work for small systems can't scale when the system grows.

---

class: middle center

#### The solution?

# Abstractions

a.k.a. modularization, or encapsulation

???

Science shows we can keep everything between four to seven things in memory at once!

At certain point, you need to introduce abstraction layers

---

## Today:

We will:

- Introduce **Phoenix contexts**
- Build a **Context Map** and use it to introduce Domain-Driven Design concepts
- Apply our learnings in code!

# Phoenix Contexts

???

Contexts dropped from the sky in Phoenix 1.3

---

class: middle

## What are contexts?

Elixir modules that group system functionality by business domain

---

class: middle center

# High cohesion

Concepts that belong together are likely to change together as a unit

---

class: middle center

# Loose coupling

Minimal dependencies on external systems

Hide implementation details to outside callers

???

Contexts have minimal dependencies on external systems (like HTTP, Plug, etc)

Contexts hide implementation details from external callers (like Ecto schemas)

---

class: background-color-code

### Follow the scaffold

Create a `User` resource in the `Identity` context

```bash
$ mix phx.gen.html Identity User users \
    name:string email:string
```

---

class: background-color-code

### Domain resource operations in the context

```elixir
# lib/my_app/identity/identity.ex
defmodule MyApp.Identity do
  def get_user!(id), do: ...
  def create_user(attrs \\ %{}) do: ...
  def update_user(%User{} = user, attrs) do: ...
  def delete_user(%User{} = user) do: ...
end
```

---

class: background-color-code

### Web controller for the resource

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/controllers/user_controller.ex
defmodule MyApp.UserController do
  def index(conn, _params) do
    users = Identity.list_users()
    render(conn, "index.html", users: users)
  end

  def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do
    user = Identity.get_user!(id)
    render(conn, "show.html", user: user)
  end
end
```

---

class: background-color-code

### Migration for Ecto persistence

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers do
  def change do
    create table(:users) do
      add :name, :string
      add :email, :string

      timestamps()
    end
  end
end
```

---

class: background-color-code

### Ecto schema

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "users" do
    field :name, :string
    field :email, :string
  end
end
```

---

### Contexts, the Phoenix way:

All web concerns live in `MyAppWeb` context.

???

The `Web` context is for anything that deals with the HTTP request/response cycle.
Headers, cookies, you name it.

--

Contexts encapsulate persistence and domain logic

???

Contexts are responsible for the implementation details of business logic.

### DDD is both:

**High-level strategic design activities**

and

**Concrete software patterns**

--

Don't get tripped up!

???

It can be very confusing as it's got a lot of concepts and
enterprise-speak. Today, we're going to pick and choose a few specific
activities and patterns to outline and apply here

---

#### Usually, we reach for

## Horizontal layers of abstractions

## Welcome to AutoMaxx! üöòüöñüöò 

A used-car marketplace

Sellers bring their cars in for an inspection and appraisal at our stores, where we buy their vehicle.

Interested buyers test drive cars in our lot, purchasing them if they are interested.

???

AutoMaxx is a two-sided marketplace

---

### Your business is constantly changing

* Marketing wants us to change copy on the web site

--
* Finance wants us to change how we do tax calculations on a car sale by region

--
* Operations wants us to build a new feature in the vehicle inventory system

--
* Product has a new initiative to offer purchase transactions in Bitcoin

--
* Customer support wants us to build a better support dashboard

## Context mapping

An exercise to help us **discover all the concepts** living in our **organization**, and our systems.

---

#### Context Mapping

## Get everyone in a room

Put up on a wall all the:

**Nouns** - entities

**Verbs** - events

---

Diagram

---

#### Context Mapping

## Group like concepts and actions together.

There may be overlaps - that's OK if your concepts belong in multiple groups.

More important to just get it down.

---

#### Context Mapping

## Take a step back.

#### Context Mapping

## Let the business lead

Listen to the words and terms they use

People should be talking

---

#### Definition! üìñ

### Core domain

The **Core Domain** is the primary area of focus of your business

--

AutoMaxx Core Domain: **Car Sales**

???

Now we're going to get into the nitty gritty of DDD - really elucidating
what defines our domain boundaries. Every software system generally
serves to fulfill its purpose in a certain operational category.

Here at AutoMaxx, we focus on used car sales. If we aren't selling used cars, this company has really lost sight of its long term vision!


---
#### Definition! üìñ

### Supporting domains

A **Supporting Domain** (or Subdomain) are the areas of the business
that play roles in making the **Core Domain** happen.

--
* **Online Listings** (put the car on the website)

--
* **Financial Transactions** (charge the buyer, pay the seller)

--
* **Optimization & Analytics** (track business metrics)

--
* **Customer Support** (keep people happy)

???

Now a subdomain is anything that supports the core domain. These are
ancillary functions, but important to help the business do its core
thing properly.

See anything interesting here? Most likely, these domains have a company
unit devoted to them.

In many companies, each of these organizational units have their own
dedicated engineering staff.

---

You might not see these yet, but your diagram may tell you:

---

## Ubiquitous Language

The terms the business speaks within each domain!

Put these in a **Glossary**

---

## What to do with your Ubiquitious Language

Speak about them consistently in the team
Use terms consistently in the code
Keep terms updated together

---

#### Definition! üìñ

### Bounded Context

- Concretely: a software system (like a codebase or running application)
- Linguistically: a delineation in your domain where concepts are "bounded", or contained

???

Remember, this is because we agreed that different domains may have
different concepts, and hence different Ubiqutious Languages.

---

## Bounded Contexts allow for precise language

Your domains may use conflicting, overloaded terms with nuances depending on context

Embrace it!

--

Bounded contexts allow these conflicting concepts to coexist


---

Aside: this is important shared vocabulary.

Write this vocabulary down and put it in a Glossary.

--

Answering: what happens to what entities in the system?

---

class: middle

#### In the I'm Being Serious Department

## Become Language Addicts

Internalize your domain!

???

If there's one thing that DDD tells us, it's to pay attention to the language, and the organization will follow.

# Elixir time! üíÅ‚Äçüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

class: background-color-code

### Contexts can expose domain entities

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def get_vehicle!() do: ...
  def list_vehicles() do: ...
  def update_vehicle() do: ...

  def get_mechanic!() do: ...

  #...
end
```

---

class: background-color-code

### Contexts can expose methods that perform domain actions

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def add_vehicle_to_garage_queue(vehicle) do: ...
  def rate_vehicle(vehicle, mechanic, inspection_rating) do: ...
end
```

---

Let's work with this user flow:

Diagram of user UI

---

class: background-color-code small-code

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.VehicleInspectionScoreController do
  def update(conn, %{
        user_id: user_id, vehicle_id: vehicle_id, score: new_score
      }) do
    with user <- Repo.get_by(User, user_id),
         vehicle <-
           Repo.get_by(Vehicle, vehicle_id)
           |> Repo.preload(:score),
         :ok <- InspectionScorePolicy.editable_by?(vehicle, user) do
      inspection_score =
        vehicle.score
        |> Score.changeset(%{value: new_score})
        |> Repo.insert!()

      render(conn, "show.html", inspection_score: inspection_score)
    else
      render(conn, "error.html", message: "Oops!")
    end
  end
end
```

???

Imagine a User -> Vehicle -> InspectionScore


---

class: background-color-code small-code

##### Move domain entities into the `Identity` context

```elixir
# lib/automaxx/identity/user.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Identity.User do
  schema "users" do: ...
end
```

##### Add domain action to the `Identity` context API

```elixir
# lib/automaxx/identity/identity.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Identity do
  def get_user(user_id) do
    Repo.get_by(AutoMaxx.Identity.User, id: user_id)
  end
end
```

---

class: background-color-code small-code

##### Move domain entities into the `Inspection` context

```elixir
# lib/automaxx/inspection/vehicle.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection.Vehicle do
  schema "vehicles" do
    belongs_to :owner, AutoMaxx.Identity.User
    has_one    :score, AutoMaxx.Inspection.Score
  end
end

# lib/automaxx/inspection/score.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection.Score do
  schema "inspection_scores" do
    belongs_to :vehicle, AutoMaxx.Inspection.Vehicle
    belongs_to :rated_by, AutoMaxx.Identity.User
  end
end
```

---

class: background-color-code small-code middle

##### Add domain action to the `Inspection` context API

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def rate_vehicle(vehicle, mechanic, inspection_score) do
    with :ok <- Inspection.ScorePolicy.editable_by?(vehicle, mechanic) do
      Repo.get_by(Inspection.Vehicle, vehicle_id)
      |> Repo.preload(:score)
      |> Inspection.Score.changeset(%{
        rated_by: mechanic.id,
        value: inspection_score
      })
      |> Repo.insert!()
    else
      {:auth_error, "Unauthorized"}
    end
  end
end
```

---

class: background-color-code small-code middle

##### Simplify the controller with your new context APIs

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.VehicleInspectionScoreController do
  def update(conn, %{
    user_id: user_id, vehicle_id: vehicle_id, score: new_score
  }) do
    with user <- Identity.get_user(user_id),
         vehicle <- Inspection.get_vehicle(vehicle_id),
         {:ok, score} <- Inspection.rate_vehicle(vehicle, user, new_score) do
      render(conn, "show.html", inspection_score: score)
    else
      render(conn, "error.html", message: "Oops!")
    end
  end
end
```

---

class: middle center

# Way better.

### What did you notice here?

* Contexts only expose methods at their outer layer.
* (Avoid exposing inner workings of contexts.)
* Use domain language when naming actions, entities and concepts.
* Craft your functions to behave like they do in the real world

???

`rate` versus `update_inspection_score`

class: middle center

# Concept sharing

Or: Double Trouble

---

class: middle center

### What happens when we need to use a `User` in a different context?

---

### Listen to the business!

**`Identity` domain**: `User`

**`Inspection` domain**: `Owner`, `Mechanic`

**`Marketing` domain**: `Visitor`

---

### A few options:

1. **Struct Conversion**: convert to internal concepts at the boundaries with pure structs

--
1. **Peer Concept**: Create an internal concept persisted in Ecto, then create a reference to the external concept

--
1. ~~**Double Trouble**: Use an overlapping internal Ecto schema over the external Ecto schema~~

--
1. **Nothing**: Just use it directly, as-is*

---

#### Sharing Concepts

## Struct Conversion

Convert external concepts to internal concepts

Useful for **Read-Only** use cases

---

##### Convert a `Identity.User` to a `Marketing.Visitor`

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Marketing.Visitor do
  defstruct [:handle, :uuid]
end

defmodule AutoMaxx.Marketing do
  def visitor_for_user(%AutoMaxx.Identity.User{} = user) do
    new_mapping = user
      |> Map.from_struct()
      |> Map.delete(:email)
      |> Map.put(:contact, user.email)
    struct(AutoMaxx.Marketing.Visitor, new_mapping)
  end
end
```

???

Idea is that your semantics for your internal concept are more fluid and in line with the business. The other idea is that you can reformat data to your use case

---

class: small-code

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Marketing.AnalyticsController do
  def create(conn, %{user_id: user_id, payload: payload}) do
    Identity.get_user(user_id)

    # Convert the concept at the boundaries
    |> Marketing.visitor_for_user()

    # Then proceed to perform the domain action
    |> Marketing.fire_analytics_event_to_google(%{payload: payload})
  end
end
```

---

### Yay Types!

Here we see the powers of pattern matching!

Reject types that do not match your internal concepts

Even better - leverage the powers of typespecs.

---

#### Sharing Concepts

## (Persisted) Peer Concept

Useful for **Read+Write** use cases

--
```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection.Mechanic do
  schema "mechanics" do
    field :is_contractor, :boolean
    field :certification, :string
    belongs_to :user, AutoMaxx.Identity.User
  end
end
```

---

class: small-code middle

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def create_mechanic_from_user(
        %AutoMaxx.Identity.User{} = user,
        is_contractor
      ) do
    %AutoMaxx.Inspection.Mechanic{
      is_contractor: is_contractor,
      user: user
    }
    |> Repo.insert!()
  end

  def mechanic_for_user(user) do
    Repo.get_by(AutoMaxx.Inspection.Mechanic, user_id: user.id)
  end
end
```

---

class: middle

#### Sharing Concepts

## This is known as an **Anti-Corruption Layer**

???

But don't get too hung up on it. Use it when it's important and the nuances are important
to capture.


---

#### Sharing Concepts

### Avoid cross-context joins if you can

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Marketing.Visitor do:
  schema "marketing_visitors" do:
    belongs_to :user, AutoMaxx.Identity.User
```
--
Instead, store them as external references

```elixir
    field :user_id, :string
    field :user_id, :uuid
```

???

This decouples our two domains.

---

class: middle center

# Aggregate Roots

From the biggest, baddest trees around

---

class: middle center

## Minimize moving pieces

What are the data structures that always belong together?

???

Minimize the data you pass around. Return a tree data structure of data that logically belongs together.

---

##### DON'T

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def get_vehicle() do: # => %Vehicle{}
  def get_vehicle_rating() do: # => %Rating{}
end
```
--
##### DO

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def get_vehicle() do:
end
# => %Vehicle{rating: %Rating{}}
```

---

class: small-code

##### DON'T

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def update_rating(rating_id, new_rating) do
    Repo.get(AutoMaxx.Inspection.Rating, rating_id)
    |> AutoMaxx.Inspection.Rating.changeset(%{value: new_rating})
    |> Repo.update()
  end
end
```
--
##### DO

```elixir
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection do
  def update_rating(vehicle_id, new_rating) do:
    Repo.get(AutoMaxx.Inspection.Vehicle, vehicle_id)
    |> Repo.preload(:rating)
    |> Map.get(:rating)
    |> AutoMaxx.Inspection.Rating.changeset(%{value: new_rating})
    |> Repo.update()
  end
end
```

---

[WIP] - what does DDD say about ARs?

This minimizes the amount of CRUD actions you must implement

This also makes your system easier to reason about.

---

class: middle center

# Event-driven messaging

For some really decoupled contexts

???

In purer forms of DDD, you would emit events over a message bus and listeners would bind to their callbacks if they are interested.

---

## Where is the coupling here?

```elixir
# lib/automaxx/identity/identity.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Identity do
  def create_user(...) do
    do_create_user()
    |> AutoMaxx.Inspection.maybe_create_mechanic()
    |> AutoMaxx.Marketing.subscribe_user_to_email_list()
    |> AutoMaxx.Analytics.track_event('user_created')
  end
end
```

---

## Publish facts (domain events) over a bus

Interested contexts can subscribe to domain events

In fact, you probably came up with these events in your context map!

---

##### Publisher:

Identity context publishes `identity.user.created`

##### Subscribers:

Marketing context puts the user on the email marketing list

Inspection context creates a corresponding `Mechanic` if the user is one

Analytics context publishes metric to Google Analytics

---

## Using the `event_bus` library

Github: [otobus/event_bus](https://github.com/otobus/event_bus)

---

class: small-code middle

```elixir
# lib/automaxx/identity/identity.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Identity do
  def create_user(...) do
    do_create_user()
    |> publish_event(:"identity.user.created")
  end

  use EventBus.EventSource

  defp publish_event(%User{} = user, event_name) do
    EventSource.notify %{id: UUID.uuid4(), topic: event_name} do
      %{user: user}
    end
  end
end
```

---

class: small-code middle

```elixir
# lib/automaxx/marketing/event_handler.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Marketing.EventHandler do
  def process({:"identity.user.created" = event_name, event_id}) do
    %{data: %{user: user}} = EventBus.fetch_event({event_name, event_id})

    AutoMaxx.Marketing.subscribe_user_to_email_list(user)
  end

  def process({:"some.other.event" = event_name, event_id}) do: ...
end
```

---

class: small-code middle

```elixir
# lib/automaxx/inspection/event_handler.ex
defmodule AutoMaxx.Inspection.EventHandler do
  def process({:"identity.user.created" = event_name, event_id}) do
    %{data: %{user: user}} = EventBus.fetch_event({event_name, event_id})

    AutoMaxx.Inspection.create_mechanic_from_user(user)
  end

  def process({:"yet.another.event" = event_name, event_id}) do: ...
end
```

---

Async, fault-tolerant approaches:

Return "job" UUID, then poll for completion.

---

Testing across boundaries:

Don't!

--

Use Mox to implement context mocks

???

Thanks to coworker Hannah for this idea.

---

For example, we are testing that the Inspection context needs to fetch up a User.

In an old world, we might have used Ecto to pick something up from the repo.

However, in DDD we factored this back behind a different context, so we wire this up with a Mox mock in our test:

---

class: background-color-code

```elixir
defmodule Inspection
  def log_inspection() do
    # ...
    Identity.get_user(user_id)
    |> do_something()
    |> # ...
  end
end
```

---

class: background-color-code

```elixir
# in test
defmodule Inspection.Test do
  setup do
  end

  test "it uses the User to perform an inspection" do
    expect(Identity.Mock)
    |> receive(:get_user)
  end
end
```

---

Suggested organization structure:

```
foo_context/
  behaviour.ex
  foo_context.ex
  foo_entity.ex
  foo_bar_entity.ex
```

```
foo_context/
  foo_mock.exs
```

---

## Prefer coarse contexts to fine contexts.

You can optimize, extract later

???

(Counter to Elixir docs)

---

class: middle center

# In conclusion

---

Listen to the business

(Build a **Context Map**)

---

Keep internal concepts isolated behind a context

---

Allow linguistic precision (and domain clarity) by being able to discern the nuances of our domain models

---

Decouple contexts even further with an event bus

---

Lean on types, pattern matching and typespecs to enforce data integrity and system boundaries

---

class: middle center

# And that's what I think makes a beautiful system
